This repository is to archive my Docker learning journey from [this udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-kubernetes-the-practical-guide).

## Goal

- To familiarize my self with Docker concepts and basics.
- To use it after as a refrence when working with Docker after.

## Basics

Docker is containr technology. It is a tool for creating and managing containers.

A container is a standarized unit of sofwtare that packages all the code and dependecoes to run the code anywhere. 

As a result, we will have the exact envirement for developement and production, also it will become easier to share a comman developement environment.

Moreover, with containers we don't have to uninstall and re-install local depedencies and runtimes all the time.

## Repository Structure
