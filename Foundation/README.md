In this section we will learn about images and containers.

## Images and Containers

**Images** are templates or Blueprints for creating containers. An Image has the container's code and required dependecies and tools to run a container. 
Images:
- Layer bases
- read-only
- application data is stored

On the other hand, **Containers** are the runtime unit of the software. We can create multiple containers from the same image.
Conatiners:
- Top layer
- read and write access
- data is lost on shutdown
